### Diversity & Inclusion across Rough Draft Ventures’ University Network

At RDV, we work with hundreds of next-generation technology leaders who have the power to drive change through the frontier technologies they are building and address key challenges facing the technology industry, including diversity and inclusion. 

In an effort to both celebrate existing diversity and inclusion initiatives across the campuses we work with, as well as provide a blueprint for student leaders to bring similar initiatives to their campuses, we’ve aggregated a list of successful programs. These initiatives provide the broader tech community with a scalable way to access diverse talent pools.
